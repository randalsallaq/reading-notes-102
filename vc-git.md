# VC
VC basically stands for: *Version Control* which is a system that allows us simply **to track** our files and to access the different versions of them. 
this system helps us in many ways such as:
1. See the history of the changes which we commited.
2. keep all the projects in one repo.
3. collaboration between the programmers to work on the same code.

so one of these control system versions is **git**. which mainly based on something we call *snapshots*. these sbapshots mean that every time you edit your file this changen will be saved as a seprate version. which means that you will find several versions of each file.
what exactly makes git special is that this system is *local*. which means that is basically exists in our machine rather like github which is in the cloud (the internet).
