# Markdown Tips..
I am going to share with you some of the tips which i have learnt on Markdown to style your writing on GitHub. So here is to you:
* headers
1. It is actyally too easy to do it here, if you want the header to be the ** largest** then you just have to add # before it. 
2. if you want it smaller you can add ###
3. if you want it more smaller you can add ######

**bold**
