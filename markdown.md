# Markdown Tips..

I am going to share with you some of the tips which i have learnt on Markdown to style your writing on GitHub. So here is to you:
* headers
1. It is actually too easy to do it here, if you want the header to be **the largest** then you just have to add # before it. 
2. if you want it **smaller** you can add ###
3. if you want it **more smaller** you can add ######

* text styling
1. to make some of your content bold you just have to add ** **before the text nad after it**
2. to make it italic you can add * *before the text and after it*
