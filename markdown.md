# Markdown Tips..

I am going to share with you some of the tips which i have learnt on Markdown to style your writing on GitHub. So here is to you:
* headers
1. It is actually too easy to do it here, if you want the header to be **the largest** then you just have to add # before it. 
ex: # Positivity
2. if you want it **smaller** you can add ###
ex: ## Positivity
3. if you want it **more smaller** you can add ######
ex: ###### Positivity

***NOTE***: with spaces


* text styling
1. to make some of your content bold you just have to add ** **before the text and after it** **
2. to make it italic you can add * *before the text and after it* *
3. to make it both bold and italic add *** ***before the text and after it*** ***

***NOTE***: without spaces.


* Quoting
1. to quote some text you can add ` ` before the text and after it, 
 ex: `No pains, no gaint` 
 
 2. to refer to the auther, add > before the name.
