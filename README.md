## GROWTH MINDSET
there are two main mindsets:
* grouth mindset
* fixed mindset
while fixed mindset is defined as the one which believes that success becomes from gifts and intellegence, **growth mindset** believes in the opposit. so we can say that growth mindset is basically about believing that anything can be acheaved and reached with being **determined, deciplined, and hubmble** to make mistakes so that you can learn new things efficiently.

###### reminders to myself:
1. accept critisism, be humble and have the spirit.
2. do not lose you focus. Do not get confused.
3. do not avoid challenges. **ACE it**.
