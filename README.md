# Reading Notes
## GROWTH MINDSET
There are two main mindsets:
* Grouth mindset.
* Fixed mindset.

While fixed mindset is defined as the one which believes that success becomes from gifts and intellegence, **growth mindset** believes in the opposit. so we can say that growth mindset is basically about believing that anything can be acheaved and reached with being **determined, disciplined, and hubmble** to make mistakes so that you can learn new things efficiently.

###### Reminders to myself:
1. Accept criticism, be humble and have the spirit.
2. Do not lose you focus. Do not get confused.
3. Do not avoid challenges. **ACE it**.
