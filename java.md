# JAVA Script
JavaScript is the Programming Language which we can use it with **HTML** update and change both HTML and CSS. Also, this language can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
If we want to define Javascript simply we cam say that `it is the element that make web pages alive`.

## interactions
it might be goood to define javascript like this. as it allows the user to interact with web page through different things that can be done using this logical language, such as:

`prompt`
`alert`

without using the java script the web pages would be very basic and static, as it is the thing which makes the web pages dynamic.
